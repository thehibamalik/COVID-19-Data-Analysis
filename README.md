# COVID-19-Data-Analysis

## Problem
In December of last year, the first known instance of Covid-19 was discovered in Wuhan, China, and impacted the way we go about our daily lives. The Covid-19 outbreak played a significant impact on global disease and socioeconomics. The study carried out contains initial pandemic data from the virus worldwide. To estimate the overall number of cases, suspected cases, and dying examples in the Northern Hemisphere, the research proposal uses the Deep Neural Network (DNN), the Random Forest Regressor, and the Linear regression model. The research uses the publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset has many features to exhibit ‘total cases', ‘new_cases', 'total_deaths' ,'new_deaths', 'total_cases_per_million' and many more. During parameter estimation, the suggested technique employs the multi-input deep neural network estimation technique only with Linear Transfer Unit (Re LU) Function as the activation function, five non-linear dense layers of 64 units, as well as a single unit of the final layer as output. As such, the testing size is 20% and the learning size is 80%, and the data is divided between training and validation sets. To make appropriate predictions, a nonlinear regression analysis is used for the normalized data. Four regression evaluation metrics Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R2 Square are used to evaluate the model's result. These evaluation metrics are used to compute for the algorithm to measure the error between real and anticipated values.

## Dataset Exploration
The dataset we used in this research contains 32584 rows and 34 columns. It contains both numerical, and categorical values features.
